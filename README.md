# Inbox-smart-contract-deployment

<strong>This project gives the developer an Introduction to coding/deploying Ethereum smart contracts .</strong>

- The Contract basically stores a message on the Ethereum Blockchain(Specifically Rinkeby Test network).
- There is no frontend for this Application since the developer has just started Coding smart contracts . Full end to end Decentrailsed applications will be coming up in future .
- Proper testing for the contract has been done before real Deployment on the Ethereum Blockchain (Rinkeby Test Network) through Mocha test framework.
- As expected Solidity Programming language has been used for coding the Contract (Template).
- web3.js library has been used for interaction of the Contract with the Ethereum Blockchain.
- Truffle HDWAllet Provider and Infura API has been used for setting up the provider .
